# Hobby-Collection
## Project Description:

I have many collectibles that I have been wanting to catalog and when prompted by my school to come up with a project, this was the first thing that came to mind. It allows me to store and access my collection across card games such as MtG, FaB, Digimon, as well as figurines from Warhammer and D&D, and eventually it will catalog the video games I own as well as the system they are on. The goal of this project is to create a functional inventory system that will demonstrate proficiency in coding, version control using Github, and collaboration.

## Project Skills Learned:

- Git and Github for version control
- Project and Task Management
- Software Development and debugging
- Documentation

## Usage:

When the app runs, it loads in the database items, displaying them, then prompts the user on whether they want to (a)dd, (d)elete, or (q)uit. when the user enters one of the letters it either asks questions for adding the item, asks the name of the item that the user wantts deleted, or stops the app.


## Installation/Operation:

To run this program, please download the program and then run the command "dotnet run" to begin.

## Future Iterations:

Currently, I am only able to add or delete single items at a time. I plan to implement the ability to add batches, and update items in the database, as well as developing a GUI.
